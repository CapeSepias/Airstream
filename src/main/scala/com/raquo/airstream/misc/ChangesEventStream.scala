  //    //  - I tried thinking about it, but couldn't confidently convince myself either way.
  //    //  - At first glance, in the simple case, an observable being started should be able to emit in the CURRENT transaction:
  //    //    since it's just being started, it hasn't emitted yet, so it won't emit more than once.
  //    //  - But that's not actually the case. The observable could have previously been started and stopped in this same transaction.
  //    //  - Or it may be possible for it to emit LATER, after some other ChangeStream (one of its ancestors) is started and emits a
  //    //    transaction. Not sure if that's actually possible.
  //    //  - Could we maybe get around some of this by tracking which transaction the observable was last stopped in, or by using
  //    //    the pending observables mechanism, or something like that? I'm not sure, and I don't have the time to prove it either way.
