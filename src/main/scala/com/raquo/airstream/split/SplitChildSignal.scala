/** This signal MUST be sync delayed after the split signal to prevent it
  * from emitting unwanted events. The reason is... complicated.
  *
  * Also, this signal is initialized at a strange time. It depends on `parent`, but it is initialized while `parent` is
  * propagating an event. So this signal can be *started* during this propagation too (e.g. in Laminar use case). Since
  * this is a signal, when started it provides its initial value to its observers. However because the parent's event is
  * still propagating, it would ALSO cause this signal to fire that event â€“ which is the same as its initial value. This
  * duplicity is undesirable of course, so we take care of it by dropping the first event after initialization IF
  * it happens during the transaction in which this signal was initialized.
